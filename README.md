## Introduction

Feedback is an essential part of any development project. Whether it's identifying bugs, revealing UX issues, or finding typos, constructive criticism can improve your app at any point in the process. But finding reviewers and managing forms can be challenging. DeveloPeer was built to remove these barriers by providing a platform where developers can exchange feedback easily and equitably.
